title: Retaining students in an evening class
---

{{ page.title }}
================

- when I started mentoring a couple years ago, I really struggled with the retention problem  
When I started mentoring at [Frauenloop](frauenloop.org) a couple years ago, we were struggling 
to keep the retention of the course up. The course was every Monday evening for 10-13 weeks. By 
the 10th week we'd usually have 20% of the students left. 

A recent conversation with a fellow mentors   
- A fellow coach mentioned the low student retention problem  
- The problem: evening classes and free courses can have a high retention rate
Before Situation: high drop out rate  
Things we did:  
- Added a small fee ( like 50 bucks a month or sth )  
- Thought real hard about the course audience ( total beginner students )  
- Picked a curriculum tailored to the audience ( self paced, lots of exercises, mostly programming)  
- Let students know: What's the purpose of the course? What will they be able to do after taking it?   

After Situation: 100% retention rate
