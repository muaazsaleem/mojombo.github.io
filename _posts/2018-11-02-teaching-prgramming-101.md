{{ page.title }}
================

## The course

- Absolute beginners' course
- KhanAcademy Intro to JS and Animation
- Two mentors answering questions, giving ocasional answers
- The purpose is to honestly answer the questions, "What is programming?"

### What I like

- Dives right into programming
- Has "real" programming assigments
- Has a teachers' dashboard!
- Had a 100% retention rate

### What students like

- No setup
- Audio lectures with a pair programming feel
- Gives good error messages
- Let's students decide if programming is something for them

### What could be better

- Sometimes uses words without introducing them
- Students still "snooze" through some challenges
- Not available in languages other than English, although google translate seems to work!
