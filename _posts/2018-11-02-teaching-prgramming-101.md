================


## Things I wish I had known

- Adults learning to program have different expectations and commitments than students learning in a university
- Designing programming exercises is pretty hard
- If you want people to have a realistic idea of what programming is, HTML & CSS aren't it
- Teaching HTML & CSS isn't _easy_ and it can be pretty time consuming
- Most online programming course have a lot of hand holding, so students never learn how to write programs on their own
- It's requires non-trivial prep to give a "lecture" on a topic and most people won't remember what was said by next week
- Iteration is key, it didn't help to take 

## How it went down

- Started volunteering for Frauenloop.org 
- Was tasked with documenting the existing courses
- We were teaching rails to total beginners
- I wondered if we could start from a more "simpler" place
- How do you teach programming in an accessible yet realistic way?
- Javascript seemed like the obvious place to start
- HTML / CSS appeared to be a necessary evil
- A few unique set of requiremnts:
  - Instructors changed every week
  - Students had varying time commitment from week to week
  - By the end of the course, wanted them to be able to write a small program on their own
  - The course needed to be accessible enough that they won't drop out
  - The course _also_ needed to be realistic enough that they would be closer to getting a job after it.


Was tasked with teaching an intro to programming course
At the time the class taught rains
The first class was doing “rails new“


About a couple years ago, I started to volunteer at [Frauenloop](https://www.frauenloop.org/). Frauenloop

I had been 
interested in helping people learn programming for a while so I was pretty excited about the oppurtunity.
This is a post about things I wish I had known as I got started. Hopefully other people in a similar situation 
will find them useful.

I was responsible for designing and teaching an intro to programming course. The students were women trying 

Until that time I was mostly only exposed to CS class at uiversity. A professor teaches a couple lecture every week, gives upto 6 hours of homework, we did 3 hours of 

The situation
  - Volunteering
  - Students had jobs and stuff
  - First time students had no intro to CS
  - People mostly wanted to get a job out of the course(s)

What does the course/class look like
- Students do an online course (freecodecamp)
- They do the tutorials and then the projects
- I go around the table checking their progress


What didn’t work:
- Trying to prepare a “lecture” every week and teach a topic
- Expecting students to get homework done every week.
- Expecting everyone to keep the same speed.
- Expecting everyone to get a topic the first time

What worked:
- Finding a “good” online course
    - One that explains things in an approachable way
    - Has lots of hands on practice without hand-holding
- Having students do the course in a self-paced way
- Encouraging them to ask questions and helping them when they get stuck


Before
- Students dropped out through out the 13 weeks course
After
- 100% students finished the course.
Next Steps
- Have a way to learn the content faster
