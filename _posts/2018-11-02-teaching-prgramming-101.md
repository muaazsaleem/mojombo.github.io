## Donts

- Don't believe that only _some_ people just "get" it.
- Don't give lectures, that teaching model is outdated.
- Don't assume everyone will make progress at the same speed.
- Don't assume that the students have all the time in the world.
- Don't assume you don't have to explain yourself.
- Don't underestimate how confusing `rails new` can be to a beginner.
- Don't assume your first course design will work.
- Don't assume students can move on without mastering basics.
- Don't assume once is enough practice.
- If you don't wanna repeat yourself, write things down.
